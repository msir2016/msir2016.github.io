          <td class="bodyText"><p align="justify" class="style2">A large number of languages, including Arabic, Russian, and most of the South and South East Asian languages, are written using indigenous scripts. However, often the websites and the user generated content (such as tweets and blogs) in these languages are written using Roman script due to various socio-cultural and technological reasons. This process of phonetically representing the words of a language in a non-native script is called&nbsp;<em>transliteration</em>. Transliteration, especially into Roman script, is used abundantly on the Web not only for documents, but also for user queries that intend to search for these documents. This situation, where both documents and queries can be in more than one scripts, and the user expectation could be to retrieve documents across scripts is referred to as&nbsp;<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=226107" target="_new" onclick="stc(this, 26)">Mixed Script Information Retrieval.</a></p>

            History</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style2">Two pilot subtasks on transliterated   search&nbsp;were introduced as a part of FIRE 2013. Subtask 1 was on language   identification of the query words and then transliteration of the   Indian language words. The subtask was conducted for three Indian   languages - Hindi, Bangla and Gujarati. Subtask 2 was on ad hoc   retrieval of Bollywood song lyrics - one of the most common forms of   transliterated search that commercial search engines have to tackle.   Five teams had participated in the shared task. </p>
            <p align="justify" class="style2">In FIRE 2014, the scope   of&nbsp;subtask 1 was extended to cover three more South Indian languages -   Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. In subtask 2, we introduced (a) queries in   Devanagari script, and (b) more natural queries with splitting and   joining of words. More than 15 teams participated in the tasks. </p>
            <p align="justify" class="style2">In FIRE 2015, the shared   task was renamed from &quot;Transliterated Search&quot; to &quot;Mixed Script   Information Retrieval&quot; for aligning it to the framework proposed by   (Gupta et al. 2014). Three subtasks were conducted. Subtask 1 was   extended further by including more Indic languages, and  transliterated   text from all the languages were mixed. Subtask 2 was on  searching   movie dialogues and reviewed along with song lyrics. Mixed script   question answering (MSQA)  was introduced as  Subtask 3.</p>

              <br />
              Being a classic application of natural language processing, question answering (QA) has practical applications in various domains such as education, health care, personal assistance, etc. QA is a retrieval task which is 
              more challenging than the task of common search engine because the purpose of QA is to find accurate and 
              concise answer to a question rather than just retrieving relevant documents containing the answer (Li and Roth,
              2002). Recently, Banerjee et al. (2015) formally introduced the code-mixed cross-script QA research problem. The first step of understanding a question is to perform question analysis. Question classification is an 
              important task of question analysis which detects the answer type of the question. Question classification helps 
              not only filter out a wide range of candidate answers but also determine answer selection strategies (Li and 
              Roth, 2002). Furthermore, it has has been observed that the performance of question classification has significant influence on the overall 
            performance of a QA system.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style2">              Let, Q = {q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, . . . , q<sub>n</sub>} be a set of factoid questions written in Romanized Bengali along with English (i.e., it 
              also contains English words and phrases). Let C = {c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>,&hellip;,c<sub>n</sub>} be the set of question classes. The task is to 
            classify each given question into one of the predefined coarse-grained classes.</p>

            Question Class: TEMPORAL</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style2"> <span class="style4">Data and Resources:</span><br />
  A dataset of questions tagged with question classes will be released as training data for this task. Participants 
  can use any other resources that they have access to.<br />
  Each entry in the dataset has the format: <em>q_no q_string q_class</em><br />
  Where, q_no, q_string and q_class refer to question number, code-mixed cross-script question string and the 
  class of the question respectively.<br />

            <p align="justify" class="style23"> <span class="style2">Social media has become almost ubiquitous in present times. Such proliferation leads to automatic<br />
  information processing need and has various challenges. Social media content is mostly informal in nature.
              Additionally while talking about Indian social media, users often prefer to use Roman transliterations of their 
              native languages and English embedding. Therefore, Information retrieval (IR) on such Indian social media 
              data is a challenging and difficult task when the documents and the queries are a mixture of two or more 
              languages written in either the native scripts and/or in the Roman transliterated form. Recently, Chakma and 
              Das (2016) have formally introduced the problem of Code&shy;Mixed Information Retrieval (CMIR) for 
              Hind&shy;English Tweets, where they have emphasized issues related with Information Retrieval (IR) for 
              Code&shy;Mixed Indian social media texts, particularly texts from twitter. CMIR was motivated by the work of 
              Gupta et. al. (2014).</span><br />
              <span class="style2">Let <em>L </em>= {<em>l</em><sub>1</sub> ,<em>l</em><sub>2</sub> ,<em>l</em><sub>3</sub> ,&hellip;, <em>l<sub>n</sub> </em>,} be the set of natural languages and <em>S </em>= {<em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>3</sub>, &hellip;, <em>s<sub>n</sub>n</em>} be the set of scripts in which 
  the languages are written. Let us assume that a word <em>w </em>written in a language with a particular script be 
  denoted as &#10216;<em>l<sub>i</sub> </em>,<em>s<sub>j</sub></em>&#10217; . When <em>i </em>= <em>j </em>, we say that the word is written in its native script otherwise, it is in 
  transliterated form. Let q be a query given over a set of documents D where the IR task is to rank the<br />
  documents in D so that the documents most relevant to q appear at the top. For a bilingual query q , where 
  the query terms may be written in Hindi and English both, we can assume that either <em>q</em>&isin; &lang;<em>li</em>&#8899;<em>lj </em>, <em>si </em>&#8899;<em>sj</em>&rang; or q&isin; &lang;l<sub>i</sub> </em>&#8899;l<sub>j</sub> , s<sub>i</sub>&rang; or q &isin; &lang; l<sub>i</sub> &#8899;l<sub>j</sub> , s<sub>j</sub>&rang; .</span></p>
